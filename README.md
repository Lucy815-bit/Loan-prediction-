Problem Statement: East African Housing Finance cCorporation deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

Here they have provided a partial data set.

The project is done in the file EA_loanPrediction, the dataset for the same is in train_test data.
The following algorithms have been used for the model fitting and prediction 

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier 

Random Forest Classification

In order to run this project
Ensure you have installed python3 and IDE of your choice, I have used google colab 
Download
EA_LoanPrediction file and open it with your Python IDE
Download the train_test dataset and load it on the IDE
data = pd.read_csv{("/content/train.csv")} replace (content/train.csv)here with your train_test datasetpath
Run all the play buttons of the program and see how it works.
Thanks
